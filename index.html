                               <p>Coffee production is a key part of the village's livelihood, providing an important source of income. The villagers take great care of their coffee trees, treating them like valuable treasures. They carefully prune, water, and protect each plant to ensure a good harvest every year. Coffee isn’t just a crop for them—it’s a big part of their culture. They drink coffee often, using it as a way to come together and enjoy time with family and friends. It’s more than just a drink; it’s a tradition that shows their hard work and brings the community closer.</p>

                                <p>Khat has become an important source of income for many families in Bedina. Although it wasn’t widely grown or used in the past, over the years it has become a common way for villagers to support themselves. Despite its addictive nature, khat is used by many as a way to stay energized and motivated during long hours of work. It's also a part of social gatherings, where people come together to chew and bond. While some worry about its effects, it remains a key part of daily life in Bedina..</p>

                                <p>Fruits are an essential part of the daily diet in Bedina, even though the village may not be widely known for fruit production. Common fruits like avocados, mangoes, and bananas are grown in abundance, especially avocados, which come in various forms. The villagers consume them regularly, often incorporating them into their meals. On occasions when there’s an excess of fruit, particularly avocados, they sell them at low prices to others in need, ensuring that nothing goes to waste.</p>

                            The Bedina clan is one of the most prominent and historically significant clans in Jimma, Oromia. It has members living in various areas, including Jimate, Guji, Ciracha, and Bedina itself. Despite their shared ancestry, many clan members are unaware of their connections due to being spread across different regions. The Bedina clan is known for its resilience, unity, and deep-rooted cultural values, which have been passed down through generations. Its prominence in the region has made it a vital part of the local heritage, contributing to the area's social and cultural identity. Whether through its historical influence or the strength of its members, the Bedina clan remains a symbol of connection and pride for those who bear its name.

                        <h4>BEDINA AS A VILLAGE</h4>
                        <p>
                            Bedina village was established after members of the Bedina clan, who were relocated during the Derg government’s villagization program, chose to return to their ancestral land. Rejecting the government-assigned settlements, they came together to build a village that reflects their unity and shared heritage. Every resident of Bedina belongs to the same clan, creating a community where everyone is connected by bloodlines and a strong sense of familial bonds. The village stands as a testament to their resilience and determination to preserve their identity and history. Despite its humble beginnings, Bedina has grown into a thriving settlement where tradition and culture remain central to the lives of its people.

                        <h4>CURRENT BEDINA</h4>
                        <p>
                            In recent years, Bedina has experienced significant growth as more members of the clan have returned to settle in the village. This expansion is fueled by the strong cultural ties that continue to attract those seeking to reconnect with their roots. The village’s economy thrives on agriculture, with coffee and khat farming being the primary sources of income for most residents. These crops have not only sustained the village but also brought recognition to the region for its high-quality produce. However, a growing challenge faces Bedina as younger generations increasingly leave the village in search of opportunities in cities and abroad. This migration has begun to erode the traditional spirit that has long defined the community. Despite these challenges, the elders and remaining residents of Bedina continue to uphold their customs, fostering a sense of pride in their heritage and striving to ensure the village remains a vibrant and meaningful home for future generations.
